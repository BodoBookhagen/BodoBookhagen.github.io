# Research Statement and Research Vision
The Earth's surface is the dynamic interface between geodynamic, geomorphologic, ecologic, hydrologic, and atmospheric processes. My research focuses on quantifying these processes and understanding feedbacks among them.

The geographic focus regions are in the Central Andes and the High Mountain Asia, including the Himalaya.
