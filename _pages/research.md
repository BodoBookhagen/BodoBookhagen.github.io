# Research Statement and Research Vision
The Earth's surface is the dynamic interface between geodynamic, geomorphologic, ecologic, hydrologic, and atmospheric processes. My research focuses on quantifying these processes and understanding feedbacks among them.

My research focuses on the Central Andes and the Himalaya.
