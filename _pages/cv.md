## Research Interests

Understanding Late Quaternary climate change, geomorphic processes,
landscape evolution, and tectonic processes through integrated studies
involving cosmogenic radionuclide dating (He, Ne, Be, Al, Cl), recent
and past climatic records, remote sensing, numerical modeling, and field
observations. Spatial scales range from hillslopes (10^0^ km^2^) to
entire mountain ranges (\~10^3^ km). For smaller scale analysis, I am
using a terrestrial laser scanner (lidar) to create high resolution,
cm-scale digital elevation models for erosion-process
deciphering.

## Scientific Research Projects

*Quaternary Climate Change and Landsliding*: Northwest Argentine Andes,
Puna Plateau, NW Himalaya, and Southern California

*Coastal Active Tectonics*: South-central Chile, southern and central
California

*Exposure-Age Dating (CRN)*: NW Himalaya, Northwest Argentine Andes,
south-central Chile, southeast Kyrgyzstan (Tien Shan), California

*Landscape Evolution*: Southeast Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyz Range, NW Himalaya,
south-central Chile, Sana Cruz Island and coastal California

*Computational Experiences*: Development of high-resolution algorithms
for the NASA TRMM Satellite, numerical landscape-evolution modeling,
Hydrological Modeling of Lake-Level Changes, thermo-kinematic modeling
of landscape evolution on long timescales (\>10^5^ y), quantification
and forward modeling of geomorphic processes, development of processing
algorithms for terrestrial lidar data

## Synergistic Activities and Professional Service

1. Designing, building, and managing a cosmogenic nuclide sample
preparation lab at UC Santa Barbara and
making it available to visiting researchers and students;

2. developing a streamlined and structured manual for cosmogenic nuclide sample
processing and making it [available](http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/pdf/bookhagen_chemSeparation_UCSB.pdf) to the geomorphological and geochemical
community (an update will be posted on github in the near future);

3. Setting up and managing a cosmogenic nuclide sample preparation lab
at the University of Potsdam; 

4. working with the NASA-TRMM (Tropical
Rainfall Measurement Mission) team to develop high-spatial resolution
algorithms for the TRMM satellite, and making a global, monthly high
spatial resolution rainfall map available for meteorological,
climatological, ecological and geomorphological research ([access data](http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/TRMM));

5. reviewing proposals, bookchapters, and journal manuscript, including
reviews for the National Science Foundation, American Chemical Society,
Natural Geographic Society, German Science Foundation (DFG), European
Science Foundation, and for journals such as (selection of journals):
*Climate Change, Climate Dynamics, Earth and Planetary Science Letters,
Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, Geology, Geomorphology,
Geophysical Research Letters, GSA Bulletin, Journal of Geophysical
Research, Journal of Hydrology, Lithosphere, Natural Hazards, Nature,
Nature Geoscience, Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences,
Quaternary Research, Science, Tectonics*
