**Research Motivation:**  The Earth’s surface is shaped by the interplay of geological, biological, and climatic forces. These interconnected systems form a complex network of feedbacks and processes. Understanding these interactions is essential—Earth’s surface underpins all human activity, and its dynamic behavior directly influences habitability, sustainability, and environmental resilience.

**Research:**  My research explores transport processes both within the Earth (vertical tectonics) and on the Earth’s surface (geomorphology), with particular emphasis on hydrologic and atmospheric drivers. I focus on quantifying Earth-surface processes through:

1. Remote sensing data and techniques
2. In-situ and field measurements
3. Geochemical analyses
4. Time series and data analytics
5. Numerical and process-based modeling

Additional tutorials, datasets, and code resources are available on the [University of Potsdam - Remote Sensing and Earth-Surface Process Team webpage](http://UP-RS-ESP.github.io/) and [Blog Posts and Tutorials](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/year-archive/). An archive of earlier materials from my time at [here](http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/).

**Teaching:** My [**teaching**](http://bodobookhagen.github.io/teaching) integrates remote sensing, earth data science, and geochemical approaches to investigate Earth-surface processes. Courses combine multiple data sources—satellite observations, field data, and model outputs—and use programming environments such as Python, C, and MATLAB. We have developed a modern curriculum in remote sensing and Earth-surface processes and coordinate the international MSc program in *Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization* (see the [University of Potsdam application portal](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/mnfakul/studium-und-lehre/master/remote-sensing-geoinformation-and-visualization.html) and the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/detail/4855/) programming listing). All teaching materials are available through the [University of Potsdam Moodle Platform](https://moodle2.uni-potsdam.de/) .

A list of advised BSc and MSc theses (year, name, topic, department) can be found in [BSc and MSc Theses](http://bodobookhagen.github.io/theses).
