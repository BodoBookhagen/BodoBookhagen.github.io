**Research Motivation:** The Earth's surface is driven by geological, biological, and climatic forces. They form a complex system of closely coupled processes - knowledge of these interactions is essential because the Earthâ€™s
surface is the foundation for all human activity and its dynamics impact all facets of life, habitability, and sustainability. 

I am interested in transport processes within the Earth (vertical tectonics) and on the Earth's Surface (geomorphology). My **research** focuses on quantifying Earth-Surface Processes using:
* remote sensing data and techniques
* in-situ and field measurements
* geochemical approaches
* time series and data analyses
* numerical modeling approaches 

Detailed information on these research topics can be found on [research](http://bodobookhagen.github.io/research). More extensive tutorial, data, and codes are available and on the [University of Potsdam - Remote Sensing and Earth-Surface Process webpage](http://UP-RS-ESP.github.io/).


My **teaching** centers around a remote-sensing and data-science focused curriculum for educating earth scientists. Specifically, we currently running an international MSc program *Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization* (see [our Department webpage](http://www.geo.uni-potsdam.de/msc-RSIV-e.html), the [university's application website](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/mnfakul/studium-und-lehre/master/remote-sensing-geoinformation-and-visualization.html), and the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/detail/4855/). My MSc teaching focus on:
* Earth System Science (transport processes within the earth, on the Earth's surface, and in the atmosphere)
* Remote Sensing of the Environment 
* Applied Remote Sensing: Aerial photogrammetry, Structure from Motion, and Lidar data
* Applied Remote Sensing: Point Cloud analyses for the Environmental sciences

At the BSc level, I am teaching introductory-level classes in remote sensing and GIS ('Grundlagen der Geoinformationssysteme').

All teaching material are available on the Moodle platform at the University of Potsdam.
