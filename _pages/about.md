**Research Motivation:** The Earth's surface is driven by geological, biological, and climatic forces. They form a complex system of closely coupled processes - knowledge of these interactions is essential because the Earthâ€™s
surface is the foundation for all human activity and its dynamics impact all facets of life, habitability, and sustainability. 

**Research:** I am interested in transport processes within the Earth (vertical tectonics) and on the Earth's Surface (geomorphology), specfically driven by atmospheric processes. My [**research**](http://bodobookhagen.github.io/research) focuses on quantifying Earth-Surface Processes using (1) remote sensing data and techniques; (2) in-situ and field measurements; (3) geochemical approaches; (4) time series and data analyses; and (5) numerical modeling approaches.

Detailed information on these research topics can be found on [research](http://bodobookhagen.github.io/research). More extensive tutorial, data, and codes are available and on the [University of Potsdam - Remote Sensing and Earth-Surface Process webpage](http://UP-RS-ESP.github.io/). An older website at my previous employer (UC Santa Barbara) can be found [here](http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/).

**Teaching:** My [**teaching**](http://bodobookhagen.github.io/teaching) centers around a combination of remote-sensing and earth-data sciences. In the classroom, we rely on a variety of data source (remote sensing, field data, modeling output), programming environments (Python, C, Matlab), and geochemical tools (e.g., cosmogenic nuclides and stable isotopes) to quantify geoscientific processes. In the past years, we have developed a modern remote sensing and earth-surface processes curriculum and we are running an international MSc program *Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization* (see [our department webpage](http://www.geo.uni-potsdam.de/msc-RSIV-e.html), the [university's application website](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/mnfakul/studium-und-lehre/master/remote-sensing-geoinformation-and-visualization.html), and the international program listed at the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/detail/4855/). All teaching material are available on the Moodle platform at the University of Potsdam.

My current MSc teaching focuses on (1) Earth System Science; (2) Remote Sensing of the Environment; (3) Applied Remote Sensing: Aerial photogrammetry, Structure from Motion, and Lidar data; (4) Applied Remote Sensing: Point Cloud analyses for the Environmental sciences; and (5) Spatiotemporal analysis of remote sensing and earth-science data using Python.

At the BSc level, I am teaching introductory-level classes in remote sensing and GIS ('Grundlagen der Geoinformationssysteme').
