We organized a workshop 'From point clouds and full-waveform data to DEM analysis' from Sep-30 to Oct-4 2019 at the University of Potsdam. Thanks to the StRATEGy graduate school, the University of Potsdam, the US-National Science Foundation EarthCube RCN "Connecting the Earth Science and Cyberinfrastructure communities to advance the analysis of high resolution topography data", OpenTopography, and UP Transfer for supporting this workshop.
